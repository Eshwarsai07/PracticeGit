git remote add origin URL -- origin name of the remote may be anything
git remote -v             -- gives number of remotes
git add .                 -- adds the changes to stagging area
git commit -m "comment"   -- commits to local rep with comment
git status
git push origin main      --  here it pushes local "main" branch to origin main
git stash                 -- store in bachstage so that it is not commited in project before doing it we need to first send the changes to staging area using git add . 
git stash pop             -- retrieving stash operations then git add .
git ls-files              -- gives list of files git is tracking 

NOTE: WE SHOULD ALWAYS PULL FIRST BEFORE PUSHING THE CHANGES THIS IS THE BEST PRACTICE.

git pull origin branchname   -- does(fetch+merge)
git push origin branchname   -- push to the remote branch
git branch -d branchname     -- to delete a branch

git log                      -- gives hist of commits of a branch including the histry of common commit
